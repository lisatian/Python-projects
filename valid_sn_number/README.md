This project scans a file of serial numbers and separates the valid and invalid serial numbers into two separate new files.

Valid serial numbers are of the format: "SN/nnnn-nnn", where n represents a digit.

The main_program.py handles the original file opening and closing, while valid_sn_functions.py performs the logic used to check serial numbers against the valid format and to separate them into two new files.
