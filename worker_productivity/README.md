Given a certain manufacturing company's assumptions of worker productivity throughout the day, that are as follows, this project prompts the user to input an hour of the day (in 24-hr format) and the number of workers present at that hour, to display the total number of pieces the company is able to produce in the given hour.

Assumptions:
- between hours of 6AM - 10AM: 30 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 10AM - 2PM: 40 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 2PM - 6PM: 35 pieces/hour/worker
