Given a certain manufacturing company's assumptions of worker productivity throughout the day, that are as follows, this project prompts the user to input an hour of the day (in 24-hr format) and the number of workers present at that hour, to display the total number of pieces the company is able to produce in the given hour.

Assumptions:
- between hours of 6am and 10pm -- produce 30 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 10am and 2pm -- produce 40 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 2pm and 6pm -- produce 35 pieces/hour/worker

The main_program.py handles the user input and calls productivity_function.py to calculate the total number of pieces produced in any given hour input by the user.
A sample file, testing.txt, is provided to show what example inputs and outputs are when using this program.
