Given a certain manufacturing company's assumptions of worker productivity, that are as follows, this project prompts the user to input an hour of the day (in 24-hr format) and the number of workers present at that hour, to display the total number of pieces the company is able to produce in the given hour.

Assumptions:
- between hours of 6AM - 10AM, they could produce 30 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 10AM - 2PM, they could produce 40 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 2PM - 6PM, they could produce 35 pieces/hour/worker
