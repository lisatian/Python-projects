A certain manufacturing company measured the productivity of its current workers:
- between hours of 6AM - 10AM, they could produce 30 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 10AM - 2PM, they could produce 40 pieces/hour/worker
- between hours of 2PM - 6PM, they could produce 35 pieces/hour/worker

This project takes an hour of the day in 24-hour format and the number of workers 
to display the total number of pieces produced during that certain hour.
